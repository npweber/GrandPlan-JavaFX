GrandPlan JavaFX 
_____________________

This is the JavaFX GUI precursor to GrandPlan, the android calendar app.

It operates nearly identically to the app, however the interface is driven by the JavaFX libary in JDK, rather than Android SDK. I chose to make it this way so I could put a GUI together for a college project and program the app later, which I did. That makes it a "precursor" to the GrandPlan project.

There isn't much to say about this project other than that since it's identical to the app with the interface tweaked. Screenshots are avalible to back that up; they should provide a nice pictoral representation of the project in its built state. (Providing a build would be hard to do outside of the development environment due to the program needing an external library and resource system).
